The Apache Software Foundation is participating in 2018's Google Summer of Code!
Apache Brooklyn, along with our fellow projects at the ASF, are welcoming
contact from potential GSoC students. You are welcome to work on your own ideas
for our project, or look at the [list of project ideas](http://s.apache.org/gsoc2018ideas)
(note that this list is for *all* of the Foundation's projects, not just
Brooklyn.)

Applications are **now open** and your final proposal must be submitted to the
Google Summer of Code website by **March 27th 2018, 16:00 UTC**. It will greatly
benefit your application if you join our community, discuss your proposals and
share your draft proposal with us before you submit your final application - see
below for more details.

## Potential students

Thank you for considering Apache Brooklyn and The Apache Software Foundation for
your GSoC project. Welcome to our community!

Firstly, if you have not already done so, please read the [Student Guide to
Google Summer of Code](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/). It
contains essential information about how to approach your project before and
after your application is submitted. Also, please read the [GSoC information
provided by The Apache Software Foundation](https://community.apache.org/gsoc.html).

Secondly, Apache values community, and the community and all its work is done in
the open, on public mailing lists and IRC channels. Please [subscribe to our
mailing lists](mailing-lists.html) and optionally [join our IRC channel](irc.html).
You can also [read our list archives](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@brooklyn.apache.org)
to see what we've discussed in the past. Observe how we do things, and then
please jump in and introduce yourself and your ideas for our project. The
["Making First Contact" page of the GSoC Student Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/making-first-contact)
will guide you here.

We, the Apache Brooklyn community, would be interested in hearing your ideas for
what and how you would like to do with your GSoC project for Brooklyn. Whilst we
have given some ideas for *what* we would like our GSoC projects to be about, we
have deliberately left the *how* up to you. Please use the mailing list to ask
questions, make suggestions, and "sound out" potential solutions that meet the
requirements. Such discussions will be valuable to you when you come to make
your formal project proposal.

We recommend against emailing project individuals directly - Apache prefers to
communicate in the open as much as possible, therefore you should direct your
emails to the public mailing list. If you have any questions which you would
prefer to ask privately, please email the project's private address at
[private@brooklyn.apache.org](mailto:private@brooklyn.apache.org).
