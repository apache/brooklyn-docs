TODO

The Developer Guide contains information on working with the Brooklyn codebase.

Of particular note to people getting started, there is:

* Help with Maven
* Help with Git
* Help setting up IDE's

And for the Brooklyn codebase itself, see:

* Project structure
* Areas of Special Hairiness

(All links are TODO.)
