## 'Path too long' when extracting Brooklyn on Windows

When trying to extract the Brooklyn binaries from the `.zip` distribution using Windows' built-in extraction utility, you may experience a
'Path too long' error. This is a due to a limitation of the in-built extraction utility. We recommend you use an alternative such as `tar`
 - which can be used with the `.tar.gz` distributable, or [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org) for the `.zip` distribution
