The Apache Brooklyn Karaf based distribution lives in brooklyn-dist/karaf/apache-brooklyn folder.
Please contact us on the
[mailing list](mailto:dev@brooklyn.apache.org) if you find any problems.

## Building

{% highlight bash %}
cd brooklyn-dist
mvn clean install
cd karaf/apache-brooklyn/target
tar -zxvf apache-brooklyn-{{ site.brooklyn-version }}.tar.gz
cd apache-brooklyn-{{ site.brooklyn-version }}
{% endhighlight %}

## Running

Start the instance with a console in the foreground using the following command

{% highlight bash %}
bin/karaf
{% endhighlight %}

This will launch the [Karaf console](https://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/users-guide/console.html)
where you can interact with the running instance. Note that Brooklyn has already started at this point
and is reachable at the usual web console url.

Start the instance as a server in the background using the following command

{% highlight bash %}
bin/start
{% endhighlight %}

The Karaf container will keep state such as installed bundles and configuration between restarts.
To reset any changes add **clean** to the cli arguments.

## Debugging

To start in debug mode use

{% highlight bash %}
bin/karaf debug
{% endhighlight %}

and connect to port 5005 using your normal Java debugger.

If you want to change dt_socket port you can pass `JAVA_DEBUG_PORT` environment variable

{%highlight bash %}
JAVA_DEBUG_PORT=5006 bin/karaf debug
{% endhighlight %}

To pause startup until the debugger is connected you can use

{% highlight bash %}
JAVA_DEBUG_OPTS='-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005' bin/karaf debug
{% endhighlight %}

For other options please check your JVM JPDA documentation.

## Configuring

Configuration of Brooklyn when running under Karaf is largely done through standard Karaf mechanisms.
See the page on [OSGI Configuration](osgi-configuration.html) for details.
