title: Logging
---

Brooklyn uses the SLF4J logging facade, which allows use of many popular frameworks including `logback`, 
`java.util.logging` and `log4j`.

The convention for log levels is as follows:

* `ERROR` and above:  exceptional situations which indicate that something has unexpectedly failed or
some other problem has occurred which the user is expected to attend to
* `WARN`:  exceptional situations which the user may which to know about but which do not necessarily indicate failure or require a response
* `INFO`:  a synopsis of activity, but which should not generate large volumes of events nor overwhelm a human observer
* `DEBUG` and lower:  detail of activity which is not normally of interest, but which might merit closer inspection under certain circumstances.

Loggers follow the ``package.ClassName`` naming standard.  

The default logging is to write INFO+ messages to `amp.info.log`, 
and DEBUG+ to `amp.debug.log`. Each is a rolling log file, 
where the past 10 files will be kept.  INFO level, and above, messages
will be logged to the karaf console. Use the log: commands in the 
karaf client, e.g. log:tail, to read these messages.

## Standard Configuration

A `org.ops4j.pax.logging.cfg` file is included in the `etc/` directly of the Brooklyn distro;
this is read by `brooklyn` at launch time.  Changes to the logging configuration,
such as new appenders or different log levels, can be made directly in this file.

Karaf logging is highly configurable.  For example enable the sift appender to log to separate log files for
each bundle as described here: [Advanced configuration](https://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/#_advanced_configuration)

A full explanation of logging in karaf is available [here](https://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/#_log).


## Log File Backup

*This sub-section is a work in progress; feedback from the community is extremely welcome.*

The default rolling log files can be backed up periodically, e.g. using a CRON job.

Note however that the rolling log file naming scheme will rename the historic zipped log files 
such that `brooklyn.debug-1.log.zip` is the most recent zipped log file. When the current
`brooklyn.debug.log` is to be zipped, the previous zip file will be renamed 
`brooklyn.debug-2.log.zip`. This renaming of files can make RSYNC or backups tricky.

An option is to covert/move the file to a name that includes the last-modified timestamp. 
For example (on mac):

    LOG_FILE=brooklyn.debug-1.log.zip
    TIMESTAMP=`stat -f '%Um' $LOG_FILE`
    mv $LOG_FILE /path/to/archive/brooklyn.debug-$TIMESTAMP.log.zip


## Logging aggregators

Integration with systems like Logstash and Splunk is possible using standard log4j configuration.
Log4j can be configured to write to syslog using the SyslogAppender
which can then [feed its logs to Logstash](http://www.logstash.net/docs/1.4.2/inputs/syslog).
