This guide describes how Brooklyn entities can be created using the Salt infrastructure management tool
 ([saltstack.com](https://saltstack.com/)).
At present Brooklyn provides basic support for Salt, operating in a 'masterless' mode. 
Comments on this support and suggestions for further development are welcome.

This guide assumes you are familiar with the basics of [creating YAML blueprints](../).
