title: Nested and Custom Workflow
layout: website-normal
---

The `type: workflow` can be used to create new step types and save them to the Brooklyn type registry.
New step types can be used in the same way as the [standard step types](steps/).
This allows common workflow logic to be saved and re-used as steps in other workflow.
The usual properties of steps -- inputs, outputs, error handling -- are all supported,
and it supports defining parameters and even custom shorthand templates.

This step type can also be used directly within a workflow to run a "nested workflow",
for instance to structure code and to isolate a sequence of steps
or to apply `on-error` behavior to a group of steps.

Nested and custom workflows are not permitted to access data from their containing workflow;
instead, they accept an `input` block like other steps.

This type permits all the [common step properties](common.md) and all the [workflow settings properties](settings.md),
plus a few others, `target`, `concurrency`, `parameters`, and `shorthand` as described below.


### Basic Usage in a Workflow

When used in a workflow, the nested workflow should be defined as a list in the `steps` key.
An `input` section can also be defined to pass data from the outer workflow to the nested workflow.

For example:

```
- log This is about to run a nested workflow
- let x=1
- ley y=2
- type: workflow
  input:
    x: ${x}
  steps:
    - log This is a nested workflow, able to see x=${x} from input but not y from the output workflow.
  on-error:
    # error handler which runs if the nested workflow fails (i.e. if any step therein fails and does not correct it) 
```

### Loops and Parallelization

The `workflow` type can also be used to run a sequence of steps on multiple targets.
If given a `target` value, Brooklyn will run the workflow against that target or targets,
as follows:

* If the target is a managed entity, e.g. `$brooklyn:entity("some-child")`, the nested workflow
  will run in the scope of that entity. It will be visible in the UI under that entity,
  and references to sensors and effectors will be aginst that entity.
* If the target is any value which resolves to a list, it will be run against every entry in the list,
  with the variable expression `${target}` available in the sub-workflow to refer to the relevant entry
* If the target is `children` or `members` it will run against each entity in the relevant list
* If the target is of the form `M..N` for integers `M` and `N` it will run for all integers in that range,
  inclusive (so the string `1..4` is equivalent to the list `[1,2,3,4]`)

Where a list is supplied, the result of the step is the list collecting the output of each sub-workflow.

If a `condition` is supplied when a list is being used, the `workflow` step will always run,
and the `condition` will be applied to entries in the list.
An example of this is included below.

By default nested workflows with list targets run sequentially over the entries,
but this can be varied by setting `concurrency`.
The following values are allowed:

* a number to indicate the maximum number of simultaneous executions (with `1` being the default, for no concurrency)
* the string `unlimited` to allow all to run in parallel
* a negative number to indicate all but a certain number
* a percentage to indicate a percentage of the targets
* the string `min(...)` or `max(...)`, where `...` is a comma separated list of valid values

This concisely allows complicated -- but important in the real world -- logic such as 
`max(1, min(50%, -10))` to express running concurrently over up to half if more than twenty, otherwise all but 10, 
and always allowing 1.
This might be used for example to upgrade a cluster in situ, leaving the larger of 10 instances or half the cluster alone, if possible.  
If the concurrency expression evaluates to 0, or to a negative number whose absolute value is larger than the number of values, the step will fail before executing, to ensure that if e.g. "-10" is specified when there are fewer than 10 items in the target list, the workflow does not run.  (Use "max(1, -10)" to allow it to run 1 at a time if there are 10 or fewer.)

#### Example

This example invokes an effector on all children which are `service.isUp`,
running in batches of up to 5 but not more than a third of the children at once:

```
- type: workflow
  target: children
  concurrency: max(1, min(33%, 5))
  condition:
    sensor: service.isUp
    equals: true
  steps:
    - invoke-effector effector-on-children
```


### Defining Custom Workflow Steps

This type can be used to define new step types and add them as new types in the type registry.
The definition must specify the `steps`, and may in addition specify:

* `parameters`: a map of parameters accepted by the workflow, with the key the parameter name,
  and the value map possibly empty or providing optional `type` (default `string`), `defaultValue` (default none),
  `required` (default `false`), `description` (default none), and/or `constraints`
* `shorthand`: a template, as described below
* `output`: an output map or value to be returned by the step, evaluated in the context of the nested workflow

When this type is used to define a new workflow step, the newly defined step does _not_ allow the
`steps` or any of the parameters listed above to be overridden.
Instead it accepts the parameters defined in the `parameters` key of the definition.
It also accepts the standard step keys such as `input`, `timeout` on `on-error`.
A user of the defined step type can also supply `output` which, as per other steps,
is evaluated in the context of the outer workflow, with visibility of the output from the current step.


#### Shorthand Template Syntax

A custom workflow step can define a `shorthand` template which permits a user
to use the workflow step as a string rather than a map, even with parameters.
The shorthand template syntax consists of a sequence of the following tokens:

* `${VAR}` - to set VAR, which should be of the regex [A-Za-z0-9_-]+(\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]+)*, 
  with dot separation used to set nested maps
* `${VAR...}` - as `${VAR}` but allowing it to match multiple words
* `"LITERAL"` - to expect the user to supply the exact token `LITERAL`;
  this should include spaces if spaces are required
* `[ <TOKENS> ]` - to indicate that a sequence of `<TOKENS>` is optional; 
  parsing is attempted first with this block, then without it

#### Example

A simple example to say hello is as follows:

```
id: greet
type: workflow
shorthand: ${name...} [ " with " ${greeting} ]
parameters:
  name:
    required: true
  greeting:
    defaultValue: Hello
steps:
- log ${greeting} ${name}
```

With this added as a registered type, workflows can write:

```
- type: greet
  input:
    name: Angela
```

The result will be the same as `log Hello Angela`.
The shorthand template spec also allows `greet Angela` for the same,
or exercising the optional block, `greet Zachary Jones with Howdy` to `log Howdy Zachary Jones`.

This is a trivial single-step example but shows the power of creating custom workflows,
especially with parameters and shorthand templates.
The [examples](examples/) and the [workflow settings](settings.md) include more realistic
illustrations of custom workflow steps.


#### Writing Workflow Steps in Java

The most common way to define custom workflow types is as workflow, using the primitives defined here,
and delegating to custom containers where the logic is best done in a higher-level programming language.
This avoids any language bias and the need to learn Brooklyn interfaces.
However it is supported to provide custom workflow step types as Java classes in a bundle.

To write a Java workflow step type, provide a class extending `WorkflowStepDefinition`,
providing implementations for the following methods:

```
Object doTaskBody(WorkflowStepInstanceExecutionContext context);
void populateFromShorthand(String value);
boolean isDefaultIdempotent();
```

The first of these does the work of the step, resolving inputs and accessing context as needed via `context`.
The second handles providing a cusotm shorthand, as described above;
it can call to a superclass method `populateFromShorthandTemplate(TEMPLATE, value)`
with the `TEMPLATE` for the class, if shorthand is to be supported.
Finally, the third returns whether the step is idempotent, that is if the custom step is interrupted,
can Brooklyn safely recover simply by rerunning it with the same inputs.
As described [here](settings.md), it is recommended to write the step so that it is idempotent if possible.

Once written, the class should be added to the Brooklyn Catalog, 
e.g. for a custom java step called `com.acme.YourJavaWorkflowStep` with shorthand name `your-step`,
create a `catalog.bom` such as the following, and `br catalog add catalog.bom`:

```
brooklyn.catalog:
  bundle: your-step-bundle
  version: "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
  items:
  - id: your-step
    format: java-type-name
    itemType: bean
    item:
      type: com.acme.YourJavaWorkflowStep
```
