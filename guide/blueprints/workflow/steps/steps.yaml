  section_name: Workflow Control
  section_intro: |
    The first group of built-in step types are those which control the flow of execution and local state within the workflow.

  steps:
    - name: let
      summary: An alias for `set-workflow-variable`.
      shorthand: '`let ["merge" ["deep"]] ["trim"] ["yaml"|"json"|"bash" ["encode"|"parse"]] ["wait"] [ TYPE ] VARIABLE_NAME [ = VALUE ]`'

    - name: set-workflow-variable
      summary: Sets the value of a workflow internal variable. The step `let` is an alias for this.
      shorthand: '`set-workflow-variable ["merge" ["deep"]] ["trim"] ["yaml"|"json"|"bash" ["encode"|"parse"]] ["wait"] [TYPE] VARIABLE_NAME [ = VALUE ]`'
      input: |
        * `variable`: either a string, being the workflow variable name, or a map, containing the `name` and optionally the `type`;
          the value will be coerced to the given type, e.g. to force conversion to an integer or to a bean registered type;
          the special types `yaml` and `json` can be specified here to force conversion to a valid YAML or JSON string;
          the `name` here can be of the form `x.key` where `x` is an existing map variable, to set a specific `key` within it
        * `value`: the value to set, with some limited evaluation as described [here](../variables.md)
      output: the output from the previous step, or null if this is the first step

    - name: transform
      summary: Applies a transformation to a variable or expression.
      shorthand: '`transform [TYPE] VARIABLE_NAME [ [ = VALUE ] | TRANSFORM ]`'
      input: |
        * `variable`: either a string, being the workflow variable name, or a map, containing the `name` and optionally the `type`;
          the value will be coerced to the given type, e.g. to force conversion to an integer or to a bean registered type;
          the special types `yaml` and `json` can be specified here to force conversion to a valid YAML or JSON string;
          the `name` here can be of the form `x.key` where `x` is an existing map variable, to set a specific `key` within it
        * `value`: the value to set, with some limited evaluation as described [here](../variables.md)
        * `transform`: a string indicating a transform, or multiple transforms separated by `|`, where a transform can be
          * `trim` to remove leading and trailing whitespace on strings, null values from lists or sets, and any entry with a null key or null value in a map
          * `merge [list|set|map] [deep] [wait] [lax]` to treat the words in the value as expressions to be combined;
            indicates the value will be a space-separated list of values, with quotes significant, usually including `$(vars)`;
            if a type is specified, all values must be compatible with that type, otherwise collection v map merge is inferred from the types;
            if `deep`, any maps containing mergeable values (lists or maps) are themselves merged deeply;
            if `wait`, unavailable sensor values are blocked on before merging;
            if `lax` then nulls, and if not waiting unavailable sensors, are silently removed
          * `wait` to wait on values (such as `${entity.attributeWhenReady...}`); must precede any expression that has to resolve values, such as `trim`)
          * `type TYPE` to coerce to registered type `TYPE`
          * `json [string|parse|encode]`: indicates the input should be converted as needed using JSON;
            if `string` is specified, the value is returned if it is a string, or serialized as a JSON string if it is anything else;
            if `parse` is specified, the result of `string` is then parsed to yield maps/lists/strings/primitives (any string value must be valid json);
            if `encode` is specified, the value is serialized as a JSON string as per JS "stringify", including encoding string values wrapped in explicit `"`;
            if nothing is specified the behavior is as per `parse`, but any value which is already a map/list/primitive is passed-through unchanged
        * `yaml [string|parse|encode]`: as per `json` but using YAML serialization and, 
          for anything other than `encode`, stripping any text before a `---` YAML document separator,
        * `bash [json|yaml] [string|encode]`: equivalent to the corresponding `json` or `yaml` transform, with `json` being the default, followed by bash-escaping and wrapping in double quotes;
          ideally suited for passing to scripts; `string` is the default and suitable for most purposes, but `encode` is needed where passing to something that expects JSON such as `jq`
        * `first`, `last`, `min`, `max`, and `average` are accepted for collections
        * any other word is looked up as a registered type of type `org.apache.brooklyn.core.workflow.steps.transform.WorkflowTransform` (or `WorkflowTransformWithContext` to get the context or arguments)
      output: the output from the previous step, or null if this is the first step

    - name: clear-workflow-variable
      summary: Clears the value of a workflow internal variable.
      shorthand: '`clear-workflow-variable [TYPE] VARIABLE_NAME`'
      input: |
        * `variable`: a string being the workflow variable name or a map containing the `name`
             of the workflow variable which should be cleared
      output: the output from the previous step, or null if this is the first step

    - name: return
      summary: |
        Returns an indicated value and specifies that the workflow should end,
        essentially equivalent to `{ type: no-op, output: VALUE, next: end }`.
      shorthand: '`return VALUE`'
      input: |
        * `value`: the value to return
      output: the value indicated

    - name: wait
      summary: |
        Waits for a value which might not yet be resolved, or a task which might not have finished,
        optionally setting the value or the task's result to a workflow variable.
      shorthand: '`wait [ [TYPE] VARIABLE_NAME = ] [ "task" ] VALUE`'
      input: |
        * `variable`: a string being the workflow variable name or a map containing the `name` and optionally the `type`
             to coerce (needed e.g. if you want to set a bean registered type, or in shorthand to set an `integer`)
        * `task`: boolean to indicate that value should be treated as a task or task ID to wait on and take its result
        * `value`: the expression to wait on and optionally set
      output: |
        the value once available if a `variable` is not being set,
        or if a variable is being set the output from the previous step or null if this is the first step

    - name: load
      summary: |
        Loads the contents of a URL into a string or coerced to a type.
        Particularly useful when reading classpath resources.
      shorthand: '`load ["charset" CHARSET] [TYPE] VARIABLE_NAME = URL`'
      input: |
        * `variable`: a string being the workflow variable name or a map containing the `name` and optionally the `type`
             to coerce (needed e.g. if you want to set a bean registered type, or in shorthand to set an `integer`)
        * `url`: the URL to load
        * `charset`: the charset to use to process the input
      output: |
        the output from the previous step or null if this is the first step

    - name: fail
      summary: Fails the workflow, throwing an exception which can be handled by an `on-error` block or returned to the user
      shorthand: '`fail [ "rethrow" ] [ "message" MESSAGE ]`'
      input: |
        * `message`: a string to report in the exception
        * `rethrow`: whether to include any error in scope (if being used within an `on-error` step)
      output: _none_ (throws exception)

    - name: retry
      summary: Retries from an appropriate point with a configurable delay and back-off
      shorthand: '`retry [ "replay" ] [ "from" NEXT ] [ "limit" LIMIT_COUNT [ "in" LIMIT_TIME ] ] [ "backoff" BACKOFF ]`'
      input: |
        * `replay`: whether to do the retry as a replay or not; 
          if done as a replay, it reverts to the workflow variables as known at the target step;
          if a `next` step is specified the default is `false`, but if there is no `next` step
          the default is `true` and `next` is taken as `end` if in an error handler and `last` otherwise,
          so blank/default `retry` behavior in an error handler is to try to replay resuming 
          and in a normal workflow to replay from the last valid replay point;
          if `replay` is specified without next, the default `next` is the `last` replay point
          (always excluding the retry step itself, even if it is a valid replay point)
        * `limit`: a list of limit definitions, e.g. `[ "10", "1h", "2 in 1 min" ]` to restrict to a max of 10 retries total,
          an additional limit of 2 in any 1 minute period, and an additional limit of 1 hour; the retry will fail if any of these are exceeded;
          as shorthand, per the syntax above, it takes one such limit definition
        * `backoff`: a specification of how to delay, of the form `INITIAL [ "increasing" FACTOR ] [ "jitter" JITTER ] [ "up to" MAX ]`,
          where `INITIAL` is one or more durations applied to the respective iteration, and the last value applying to all
          unless an `increasing FACTOR` is supplied; 
          `FACTOR` as either a number followed by `x` to multiply, a number followed by by `%` to add a percentage each time, 
          or a duration to increase linearly; 
          `JITTER` as either a percentage or real factor by which to jitter the result with randomness, 0 being none, 100% being up to double, and -100% being down to zero;
          and `MAX` to specify a maximum duration; for example,
          `backoff 1s 1s 10s` will retry after 1 second the first two times, then after 10 seconds on subsequent instances; 
          and `backoff 1s 2s backoff 3x max 1m` will retry after 1 second then 2s then 6s then 18s then 54s then 60s each subsequent time 
        * `hash`: an optional hash expression to identify related retries in a workflow instance; all retry blocks with the same `hash` will share counts
          for the purpose of counting limits (although the limits themselves are as per the definition in each retry block),
          which can be useful if there are different steps which might fail in different ways but the overall retry behaviour should be preserved
        * `next` per the [common](../common.md) step properties, with special targets 
          `last` for the last replayable step
          (the default if not in an error handler or if `replay` is specified) and 
          `end` to replay resuming (only permitted in an error handler where it is the default if `replay` is not specified)
      output: the output from the previous step, or null if this is the first step

    - name: goto
      summary: Moves execution to another step indicated by its ID
      shorthand: '`goto NEXT`'
      input: |
        * `next` per the [common](../common.md) step properties
      output: the output from the previous step, or null if this is the first step

    - name: switch
      summary: Concisely selects and runs the first matching step case, like `if ... else if ... else`
      shorthand: '`switch [ VALUE ]`'
      input: |
        * `cases`: a list of steps, all but the last with a `condition`, and the first applicable will be run, the others not;
          error if none match (where the last has a `condition`)
        * `value`: a value passed to each of the conditions as the `target`
      output: the output from the matched case step

    - name: workflow
      summary: |
        Runs nested workflow, optionally over an indicated target.
        This step type is described in more detail [here](../nested-workflow.md).
        It can also
      shorthand: '`workflow [ replayable REPLAYBLE ] [ retention RETENTION ]`' or custom
      input: |
        * `steps`: a list of steps to run, run in a separate context
        * `target`: an optional target specifier, an entity or input to the steps for the sub-workflow,
          or if a list, a list of entities or inputs to pass to multiple sub-workflows
        * `concurrency`: a specification for how many of the sub-workflows can be run in parallel, if given a list target;
          defaulting to one at a time, supporting a DSL as described [here](../nested-workflow.md)
        * `condition`: the usual condition settable on steps as described [here](../common.md) can be used, with one difference
          that if a target is specified, the condition is applied to it or to each entry in the list, to conditionally allow sub-workflows,
          and the workflow step itself will always run (i.e. the condition does not apply to the step itself if it has a target)
        * `replayable`: instructions to add or modify replay points, as described [here](../settings.md), for example `workflow replayable from here`
        * `retention`: instructions to modify workflow retention, as described [here](../settings.md)
      output: the output from the last step in the nested workflow, or a list of such outputs if supplied a `target` list

  section_name: External Actions
  section_intro: |
    The next group of step types are those which typically do the "real work" by interacting with
    external resources in the real world.

  steps:

      summary: |
        Runs a container with optional command and environment variables.
      shorthand: '`container IMAGE [ COMMAND ]`'
      input: |

        * Optionally a command to pass to the image, at most one of:
            * `command`: a command or script as a string, to pass to bash to be run
            * `commands`: a list of commands to pass to bash to be run

        * `pull_policy`: one of `IfNotPresent`, `Always`, or `Never`, whether to pull the image before running;
             defaults to `IfNotPresent`
        * `output_max_size`: by default output from commands is limited to 100k, truncating to keep the end; this can be increased or decreased,
          or disabled with `-1` (assuming Apache Brooklyn has sufficient memory to hold the data)
      output: |
        * `stdout`
        * `stderr`
        * `exit_code`


    - name: http
      summary: Sends an HTTPS (or HTTP) request and returns the response content and code.
      shorthand: '`http ENDPOINT`'
      input: |
        * `endpoint`: the URL to connect to, optionally omitting the protocol and slash prefix if `https://` is intended
             (e.g. just the host and any path); per URL standard any unusual characters such as query parameters should be URL-encoded,
             so if e.g. passing parameters containing spaces, `params` should be used instead of `host/path?param=${value}`
        * `query`: a map of query parameters to URL encode and add to the URL
        * `body`: an object to be serialized and sent as the body (or just set as body if it is an array of bytes)

             not applied if `body` is already a byte array, and not applied to the `content_bytes` output;
             defaults to the system default
        * `status_code`: the word `any`, a number, or a predicate DSL expression to require of the response status code,
             defaulting to `{ less-than: 400, greater-than-or-equal-to: 200 }`
        * `headers`: a map of header key-values to set on the request
        * `method`: the HTTP method for the request, defaulting to `get`
        * `username` and `password`: credentials to set on the request, e.g. for Basic auth
             (other auth schemes can be implemented using `headers`)
        * `config`: allows configuration of HTTPS, specifically a map of booleans `laxRedirect`, `trustAll`, and `trustSelfSigned`;
             defaults to entity config or `brooklyn.properties` values of the same keys prefixed with
             `brooklyn.https.config.`, and otherwise defaulting to `false` for each for security;
             this allows e.g. configuration to work with self-signed hosts where the network is trusted
      output: |
        * `status_code`: integer status code, e.g. 200
        * `headers`: a map of header keys to a _list_ of values for that header on the response (as multiple values are permitted)
        * `content`: the content, converted to a string using `charset`
        * `content_bytes`: the content, as a raw byte array
        * `duration`: how long the request took

    - name: ssh
      summary: Runs a command over ssh.
      shorthand: '`ssh COMMAND`'
      input: |

          or disabled with `-1` (assuming Apache Brooklyn has sufficient memory to hold the data)

      #  [//]: # (* `endpoint`: an alternative endpoint &#40;format TODO&#41;; typically this is omitted and the SSH machine location of the entity is the target)
      #  [//]: # (* `key`: a private key to use for the connection to the endpoint &#40;TODO, again typically embedded in the SSH machine location of the entity&#41;)
      output: |
        * `stdout`
        * `stderr`
        * `exit_code`

                         to require of the exit status code from the command, defaulting to `0`
        * `output_max_size`: by default output from commands is limited to 100k, truncating to keep the end; this can be increased or decreased,

      input: |
        * `effector`: the name of the effector to invoke
        * `entity`: optional entity or entity ID where the effector should be invoked
        * `args`: map of argument names to values to pass to the effector
      output: the returned object from the invoked effector

        * `config`: either a string, being the config key name, or a map, containing the `name` and 
          optionally the `type` (defaulting to the declared type of the config key, if present, or to `Object`)
          and/or the `entity` where the config should be set (defaulting to the entity where the workflow is running);

        * `sensor`: either a string, being the sensor name, or a map, containing the `name` and 
          optionally the `type` (defaulting to the declared type of the sensor, if present, or to `Object`)
          and/or the `entity` where the sensor should be set (defaulting to the entity where the workflow is running);

        * `entity`: the entity or entity ID where the adjunct should be added, defaulting to the current entity
        * `unique-tag`: a tag to uniquely identify this adjunct, defaulting to the workflow step; this will replace any instance with the same unique-tag at the entity
          (to make the operation idempotent)
