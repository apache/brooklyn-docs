This guide describes how Brooklyn entities can be created using the Ansible infrastructure management tool
 ([ansible.com](http://ansible.com)).
At present Brooklyn provides basic support for Ansible, operating in a 'masterless' mode. 
Comments on this support and suggestions for further development are welcome.

This guide assumes you are familiar with the basics of [creating YAML blueprints](../).
