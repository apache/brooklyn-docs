## Root Elements

* `name`: human readable names
* `services`: a list of `ServiceSpecification` elements
* `location` (or `locations` taking a list): a `LocationSpecification` element as a string or a map


## Service Specification Elements

Within the `services` block, a list of maps should be supplied, with each map
defining a `ServiceSpecification`.  Each `ServiceSpecification` should declare the
service `type` (synonyms `serviceType` and `service_type`), indicating what type of 
service is being specified there.  The following formats are supported for
defining types:

* `com.acme.brooklyn.package.JavaEntityClass`
* `java:com.acme.brooklyn.package.JavaEntityClass`
* `java-entity-class` (where this has been added to the [catalog]({{ site.path.guide }}/blueprints/catalog/))

A reference of some of the common service `type` instances used is included in a section below.

Within the `ServiceSpecification`, other key-value pairs can be supplied to customize
the entity being defined, with these being the most common:

* `id`: an ID string, used to refer to this service

* `location` (or `locations`): as defined in the root element 
  
* `brooklyn.config`: configuration key-value pairs passed to the service entity being created;
  complex values are supported if they are JSON-deserializable beans that have been added as registered types

* `brooklyn.children`: a list of `ServiceSpecifications` which will be configured as children of this entity

* `brooklyn.policies`: a list of policies, each as a map described with their `type` and their `brooklyn.config` as keys

* `brooklyn.enrichers`: a list of enrichers, each as a map described with their `type` and their `brooklyn.config` as keys;
  see the keys declared on individual enrichers; 
  also see [this enricher example](example_yaml/test-app-with-enrichers-slightly-simpler.yaml) for a detailed and commented illustration
  <!-- TODO assert that this yaml maches the yaml we test against -->

* `brooklyn.initializers`: a list of `EntityInitializer` instances to be constructed and run against the entity, 
  each as a map described with their `type` (Java or a registered type in the catalog) and JSON-serializable fields. 
  
  An `EntityInitializer` can perform arbitrary customization to an entity whilst it is being constructed,
  such as adding dynamic sensors and effectors.
  
  Some common initializers are:
  
  * `org.apache.brooklyn.core.effector.ssh.SshCommandEffector`: takes a `name` and `command`,
    and optionally a map of named `parameters` to their `description` and `defaultValue`,
    to define an effector with the given name implemented by the given SSH command
    (on an entity which as an ssh-able machine)

  * `org.apache.brooklyn.core.sensor.ssh.SshCommandSensor`: takes a `name` and `command`,
    and optionally a `period`, to create a sensor feed which populates the sensor with
    the given name by running the given command (on an entity which as an ssh-able machine)

  * `org.apache.brooklyn.core.sensor.windows.WinRmCommandSensor`: For a command supplied via WinRm. Takes a `name`, `command`,
    and optionally a `period` and `executionDir`, to create a sensor feed which populates the sensor with
    the given name by running the given command (on an entity which as an WinRM-able machine).<br/>
    _`"~"` will use the default execution directory for the WinRm session which is usually `%USERPROFILE%`_
  
  When specifying the type of an initializer, registered types (added to the catalog) are preferred,
  but Java types are permitted.
  
  Advanced note:  When implementing an initializer in Java, it is preferred to rely on standard Jackson serialization techniques to initialize fields, 
  i.e. have a no-arg constructor and fields which can be specified in YAML.
  However it is permitted for backwards compatibility, to supply configuration under a `brooklyn.config` key;
  via a public constructor taking a single `ConfigBag` (or sometimes a `Map`) 
  where the `brooklyn.config` key-values are passed in.
  This approach has several constraints however. 
  The config inheritance modes which are used on entities and other spec types are not recognised here.
  If the type is added to the catalog and referred to by its registered type name,
  or if registered types are being passed as config,
  the class must support JSON deserialization of `brooklyn.config`,
  and that is strongly recommended since Apache Brooklyn v1.1.
  This can be done by ensuring a no-arg constructor is defined and
  supplying a `@JsonSetter("brooklyn.config") initializeConfig(Map<String,Object)` method.
  There are convenience abstract classes in `EntityInitializers` which can be useful for more complicated configurations.

* `brooklyn.parameters`: documents a list of typed parameters the entity accepts.
  These define config keys exposed on the type, including metadata for prompting a user to supply them.
  All config keys inherited from supertypes are available as parameters by default, 
  and their properties (e.g. default values) can be overridden. 
  Parameters (config keys) have the following properties:
  * `name` (required): identifier by which to reference the parameter when setting
    or retrieving its value
  * `label`: an identifier string to present to the user when prompting for a value, same as `name` if empty
  * `description`: short text describing the parameter behaviour/usage, presented
    to the user
  * `type`: the type of the parameter, one of `string`, `integer`, `long`, `float`,
    `double`, `timestamp`, `duration`, `port`, or a fully qualified Java type name;
    the default is `string`;
    obvious coercion is supported so 
    `timestamp` accepts most common ISO date formats, `duration` accepts `5m`, and port accepts `8080+`
  * `default`: a default value; this will be coerced to the declared `type`
  * `pinned`: mark the parameter as pinned (always displayed) for the UI. The default is `true`
    (unless an ancestor sets false; config keys from Java types are _not_ pinned)
  * `constraints`: a list of constraints the parameter should meet;
    for details, see [Entity Configuration]({{ site.path.guide }}/blueprints/entity-configuration.html#config-key-constraints).

  A shorthand notation is also supported where just the name of the parameter can be supplied
  as an item in the list, with the other values being unset or the default.
  See `displayName` in the following example for an illustration of this:

  ~~~ yaml
  brooklyn.parameters:
    # user.age parameter is required, pinned and fully specified
    - name: user.age
      type: integer
      label: Age
      description: the age of the user
      pinned: true
      constraints:
      - required
    # user.name is optional, is not pinned and has a default
    - name: user.name
      default: You
      pinned: false
    # shorthand notation: displayName will be an optional config of type string with no default
    - displayName
  ~~~

  Referencing the parameters from within java classes is identical to using config keys. In yaml it's
  usually referenced using `$brooklyn:scopeRoot().config("displayName")`. See below for more details on scopes.

* `brooklyn.tags`: a list of tag objects which should be attached to the entity.

Entities (and policies and enrichers) will typically accept additional key-value pairs
as per the config keys (parameters) they expose.  In some cases they may accept other fields
(where fields in a Java class are annotated `@SetFromFlag` although this is discouraged),
but undeclared config is only accepted in the `brooklyn.config` map.
Global config can be passed in either at the root of the `ServiceSpecification` 
or in a root `brooklyn.config` section.

Initializers and custom types used as config/parameters are treated as beans, with fields at the root.
However in many cases initializers also accept configuration passed in a `brooklyn.config` section.
To accept expressions using the Brooklyn DSL (`$brooklyn:xxx`) in fields of beans,
the field type should be declared as a `WrappedValue<T>`, where `T` is the desired type.
(Config key values will always accept the Brooklyn DSL without this, but fields will not.)


## Location Specification Elements

<!-- TODO - expand this, currently it's concise notes -->

In brief, location specs are supplied as follows, either for the entire application (at the root)
or for a specific `ServiceSpecification`:

    location:
      jclouds:aws-ec2:
        region: us-east-1
        identity: AKA_YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
        credential: <access-key-hex-digits>

Or in many cases it can be in-lined:

    location: localhost
    location: named:my_openstack
    location: aws-ec2:us-west-1

For the first immediately, you'll need password-less ssh access to localhost.
For the second, you'll need to define a named location in `brooklyn.properties`,
using `brooklyn.location.named.my_openstack....` properties.
For the third, you'll need to have the identity and credentials defined in
`brooklyn.properties`, using `brooklyn.location.jclouds.aws-ec2....` properties.

If specifying multiple locations, e.g. for a fabric:

    locations:
    - localhost
    - named:my_openstack
    - aws-ec2:us-east-2   # if credentials defined in `brooklyn.properties
    - jclouds:aws-ec2:
        region: us-east-1
        identity: AKA_YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
        credential: <access-key-hex-digits>

If you have pre-existing nodes, you can use the `byon` provider, either in this format:

    location:
      byon:
        user: root
        privateKeyFile: ~/.ssh/key.pem
        hosts:
        - 81.95.144.58
        - 81.95.144.59
        - brooklyn@159.253.144.139
        - brooklyn@159.253.144.140

or:

    location:
      byon:
        user: root
        privateKeyFile: ~/.ssh/key.pem
        hosts: "{81.95.144.{58,59},brooklyn@159.253.144.{139-140}"

You cannot use glob expansions with the list notation, nor can you specify per-host
information apart from user within a single `byon` declaration.
However you can combine locations using `multi`:

    location:
      multi:
        targets:
        - byon:
            user: root
            privateKeyFile: ~/.ssh/key.pem
            hosts:
            - 81.95.144.58
            - 81.95.144.59
        - byon:
            privateKeyFile: ~/.ssh/brooklyn_key.pem
            hosts: brooklyn@159.253.144{139-140}


## DSL Commands

Dependency injection other powerful references and types can be built up within the YAML using the
concise DSL defined here:
 
* `$brooklyn:attributeWhenReady("sensor")` will store a future which will be blocked when it is accessed,
  until the given `sensor` from this entity "truthy" (i.e. non-trivial, non-empty, non-zero) value
  (see below on `component` for looking up values on other sensors) 
* `$brooklyn:config("key")` will insert the value set against the given key at this entity (or nearest ancestor);
  can be used to supply config at the root which is used in multiple places in the plan
* `$brooklyn:sensor("sensor.name")` returns the given sensor on the current entity if found, or an untyped (Object) sensor;
  `$brooklyn:sensor("com.acme.brooklyn.ContainingEntityClass", "sensor.name")` returns the strongly typed sensor defined in the given class
* `$brooklyn:entity("ID")` refers to a Brooklyn entity with the given ID; you can then access the following subfields,
  using the same syntax as defined above but with a different reference entity,
  e.g. `$brooklyn:entity("ID").attributeWhenReady("sensor")`:
  * `.attributeWhenReady("sensor")`
  * `.config("key")`
  * `.sensor("sensor.name")`
* `$brooklyn:component("scope", "ID")` is also supported, to limit scope to any of
  * `global`: looks for the `ID` anywhere in the plan
  * `child`: looks for the `ID` anywhere in the child only
  * `descendant`: looks for the `ID` anywhere in children or their descendants
  * `sibling`: looks for the `ID` anywhere among children of the parent entity
  * `parent`: returns the parent entity (ignores the `ID`)
  * `this`: returns this entity (ignores the `ID`)
* `$brooklyn:root()` will return the topmost entity (the application)
* `$brooklyn:scopeRoot()` will return the root entity in the current plan scope.
  For catalog items it's the topmost entity in the plan, for application plans it is the same as
  `$brooklyn:root()`.
* `$brooklyn:formatString("pattern e.g. %s %s", "field 1", "field 2")` returns a future which creates the formatted string
  with the given parameters, where parameters may be strings *or* other tasks such as `attributeWhenReady`
* `$brooklyn:urlEncode("val")` returns a future which creates a string with the characters escaped
  so it is a valid part of a URL. The parameter can be a string *or* another task. For example,
  `$brooklyn:urlEncode($brooklyn:config(\"mykey\"))`. It uses "www-form-urlencoded" for the encoding,
  which is appropriate for query parameters but not for some other parts of the URL (e.g. space is encoded as '+').
* `$brooklyn:literal("string")` returns the given string as a literal (suppressing any `$brooklyn:` expansion)
* `$brooklyn:object(Map)` creates an object, using keys `type` to define the java type,
  and either `object.fields` or `brooklyn.config` to supply bean/constructor/flags to create an instance
* `$brooklyn:entitySpec(Map)` returns a new `ServiceSpecification` as defined by the given `Map`,
  but as an `EntitySpec` suitable for setting as the value of `ConfigKey<EntitySpec>` config items
  (such as `dynamiccluster.memberspec` in `DynamicCluster`)

<!-- TODO examples for object and entitySpec -->

Parameters above can be supplied either as strings or as lists and maps in YAML, 
and the `$brooklyn:` syntax can be used within those parameters.  


## Some Powerful YAML Entities

All entities support configuration via YAML, but these entities in particular 
have been designed for general purpose use from YAML.  Consult the Javadoc for these
elements for more information:

* **Vanilla Software** in `VanillaSoftwareProcess`: makes it very easy to build entities
  which use `bash` commands to install and the PID to stop and restart
* **Chef** in `ChefSoftwareProcess`: makes it easy to use Chef cookbooks to build entities,
  either with recipes following conventions or with configuration in the `ServiceSpecification`
  to use arbitrary recipes 
* `DynamicCluster`: provides resizable clusters given a `dynamiccluster.memberspec` set with `$brooklyn.entitySpec(Map)` as described above 
* `DynamicFabric`: provides a set of homogeneous instances started in different locations,
  with an effector to `addLocation`, i.e. add a new instance in a given location, at runtime

## Notable Tags

Some tags are used by convention and in the UI for special purposes.
These are:

* `ui-composer-annotation`: text (interpreted as markdown without HTML support) which will be displayed on a node in the Blueprint Composer,
  or a map containing a key with the `text` and optionally any/all of `{x, y, width, height, background, style, styleInnerDiv}` for displaying it.
  The display of these can be toggled in the Blueprint Composer by selecting "Layers > Annotations".
  This is illustrated in the following blueprint:

  ~~~ yaml
  name: Annotation Sample
  services:
  - type: server
    brooklyn.tags:
      - ui-composer-annotation: A simple default annotation
      - ui-composer-annotation:
          text: >-
            Shown below, yellow text, centered with CSS. Because it's long, scroll bars horizontally and vertically shown when
            needed.
          styleInnerDiv: 'margin: auto; color: yellow;'
          y: 120
  - type: server
    brooklyn.tags:
      - ui-composer-annotation:
          text: |
            ## Big Example
            A **red** tag at _right_, using markdown, in a big box.
          width: 300
          height: 200
          x: 220
          y: 0
          background: '#ffcccc'
          style: 'font-size: 9px;'
  ~~~

* `ui-composer-hints`: a collection of tags typically on an entity definitiion providing hints to composers,
  including `config-widgets` (setting custom widgets to render fields) and `config-quick-fixes` (proposals for fixing common errors);
  see the code for the Blueprint Composer for more details
